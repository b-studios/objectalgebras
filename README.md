# Object Algebras
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/b-studios/objectalgebras.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/b-studios/objectalgebras)

Syntactic sugar for object algebras, implemented using macros.

Be warned: This library is very pre-alpha, uses experimental Scala features and some type level hackery. So only use on your own risk.
